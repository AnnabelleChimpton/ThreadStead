# Personal Project Plan: ThreadRings Migration to Ring Hub

## üéØ Executive Summary

This plan coordinates development across two repositories to successfully extract ThreadRings from ThreadStead into a standalone Ring Hub service, enabling true decentralization while maintaining development velocity.

**Duration**: 10-12 weeks  
**Approach**: Parallel development with direct integration  
**Risk Level**: Low (no production data to migrate, feature flag protected)  
**Success Criteria**: Feature-complete Ring Hub with ThreadStead integration

**Key Advantage**: Since ThreadRings are behind a feature flag with no production data, we can develop Ring Hub and integrate it directly without complex migration procedures.

**Source Documents Integrated**:
- `THREADRING_REFACTOR_TODO.md` - ThreadStead integration phases
- `RING_HUB_BUILD_TODO.md` - Ring Hub development phases  
- `THREADRINGS_TODO.md` - Current ThreadRing features to implement
