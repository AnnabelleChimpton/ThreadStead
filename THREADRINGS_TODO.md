## Feature Overview

**What is a ThreadRing?**
- A community with a curator (creator/owner) and members
- Users can associate their posts with one or more ThreadRings they belong to
- Each ThreadRing has its own page showing posts from members, member list, and ring info
- Join settings: open join, invite only, or closed
- **Forkable**: ThreadRings can be forked into derivative communities
- Similar to old webrings but with modern social features

## Database Schema Changes

### New Models Needed

1. **ThreadRing** - Core ring entity
2. **ThreadRingMember** - Junction table for ring membership
3. **PostThreadRing** - Junction table for post-ring associations
4. **ThreadRingInvite** - Invitation system
5. **ThreadRingFork** - Track forking relationships between rings

### New Enums
- `ThreadRingJoinType` (open, invite, closed)
- `ThreadRingVisibility` (public, unlisted, private) 
- `ThreadRingRole` (member, moderator, curator)
- `ThreadRingInviteStatus` (pending, accepted, declined, revoked)

See `prisma/schema.prisma` for detailed schema comments.

## Notes for Implementation

- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Use existing UI components and styling patterns
- Maintain consistency with current permission model
- Consider performance with larger ring memberships
- Plan for future features like ring themes, advanced moderation
- ThreadRing slugs should be globally unique and URL-friendly
- Consider rate limiting for ring creation, forking, and invitations
- **Fork notifications should be soft/ambient** - appear in ring feed but not as urgent notifications
- Forked rings should maintain some connection to their origin for discovery
- Consider limits on fork depth or fork chains to prevent spam
- **Visibility enforcement is critical**: Ring syndication must never widen post visibility scope
- **Federation-ready from day one**: Use canonical URIs to avoid painful migrations later
- **Performance-first**: Denormalized counters and strategic indexes for trending/discovery
- **Audit everything**: Moderation actions need trails for dispute resolution
- **Post badges everywhere**: Make ring membership visible on all post displays
- **Soft notifications with CTAs**: Fork notifications should include "View/Join" actions
- **Block lists prevent abuse**: Both actor-level and instance-level blocking for safety

## ✅ Phase 5A Implementation Summary: The Spool Architecture (Partially Complete)

**What was completed in Phase 5A:**

### Database & Schema Updates
- ✅ **Migration Applied**: `20250820020956_add_spool_architecture` - Added hierarchical fields to ThreadRing schema
- ✅ **Hierarchical Fields Added**: `parentId`, `directChildrenCount`, `totalDescendantsCount`, `lineageDepth`, `lineagePath`, `isSystemRing`
- ✅ **The Spool Created**: Universal parent ThreadRing with `isSystemRing: true`, acts as genealogy root
- ✅ **Orphaned Ring Migration**: All existing ThreadRings automatically assigned The Spool as parent with correct lineage data
- ✅ **Counter Initialization**: The Spool's descendant counters properly set (6 direct children, 6 total descendants)

### API & Logic Updates
- ✅ **Fork Creation Enhanced**: `/api/threadrings/[slug]/fork.ts` now properly calculates lineage and updates ancestor counters
- ✅ **ThreadRing Creation Enhanced**: `/api/threadrings/create.ts` automatically assigns The Spool as parent for new rings
- ✅ **Incremental Counters**: O(log n) performance - updates proportional to tree depth, not total ring count
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: All hierarchical operations use database transactions for atomicity
- ✅ **Ancestor Updates**: Fork creation properly increments ALL ancestor descendant counts

### Setup Integration
- ✅ **Admin Setup Enhanced**: `scripts/setup-admin.ts` automatically creates The Spool during server setup
- ✅ **Zero User Action Required**: The Spool architecture is completely automatic for new server deployments
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Existing servers get The Spool when admin setup runs again

### Feature Flag Fix
- ✅ **Hydration Error Fixed**: Updated `THREADRINGS_ENABLED` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_THREADRINGS_ENABLED` to prevent server/client mismatch
- ✅ **Navigation Consistent**: ThreadRings link now renders consistently without hydration warnings

### Frontend Work - The Spool Landing Page
- ✅ **Unique Template Created**: Special landing page for The Spool with no posts, only genealogy information
- ✅ **Stats Display**: Shows total descendants count (all ThreadRings) and direct children count
- ✅ **Genealogy Portal**: Placeholder section for future interactive tree visualization
- ✅ **Community Discovery**: Links to browse all communities and create new ones
- ✅ **Feature Flag Protected**: Only shows enhanced Spool page when threadrings feature is enabled
- ✅ **About Section**: Detailed explanation of The Spool's role as genealogy root
- ✅ **Navigation Enhancement**: Main nav now points directly to The Spool instead of generic ThreadRings directory

### Files Created/Modified in Phase 5A

#### Database
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Enhanced ThreadRing model with hierarchical fields and system ring support
- `prisma/migrations/20250820020956_add_spool_architecture/migration.sql` - Applied successfully

#### Scripts
- `scripts/setup-admin.ts` - Enhanced to create The Spool and assign orphaned rings automatically  
- `scripts/create-spool.ts` - Standalone script for creating The Spool and migrating existing rings
- `scripts/verify-spool.ts` - Verification script to check The Spool architecture integrity
- `scripts/test-fork-hierarchy.ts` - Testing script for fork hierarchy calculations
- `scripts/test-api-hierarchy.ts` - Testing script for API hierarchy logic

#### API Endpoints
- `pages/api/threadrings/create.ts` - Enhanced to assign The Spool as parent and update counters for new rings
- `pages/api/threadrings/[slug]/fork.ts` - Enhanced with proper lineage calculation and ancestor counter updates

#### Frontend Components
- `pages/threadrings/[slug].tsx` - Enhanced with SpoolLandingPage component and hierarchical field support for The Spool
- `components/Layout.tsx` - Updated main navigation to point to The Spool instead of ThreadRings directory

#### Configuration
- `.env` - Updated feature flag from `THREADRINGS_ENABLED` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_THREADRINGS_ENABLED`
- `lib/feature-flags.ts` - Updated to use public environment variable for consistent server/client rendering

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- **O(1) Descendant Queries**: Instant lookup via denormalized counters (`totalDescendantsCount`)
- **O(log n) Fork Operations**: Updates scale with tree depth, not total ring count
- **Atomic Hierarchy**: Database transactions ensure genealogy consistency
- **Efficient Ancestry**: Lineage path enables fast ancestor/descendant queries using simple string operations
- **Zero Migration Pain**: Completely automatic setup for new and existing servers

**Production Ready:** Phase 5A is fully functional! All new ThreadRing creation and forking maintains proper hierarchical relationships with The Spool as the universal genealogy root.

**Updated Status:** With The Spool Landing Page complete, Phase 5A now includes both backend architecture AND the first frontend component. Users can experience the genealogy concept through The Spool's unique interface.

**Phase 5B Status: Interactive genealogy tree is now live! Users can explore the complete ThreadRing family tree.**

### The Spool - Universal Parent ThreadRing

**Concept**: All ThreadRings will architecturally trace back to a single symbolic parent ThreadRing called "The Spool". This creates a unified genealogical tree for all communities.

**The Spool Characteristics**:
- **Symbolic Nature**: More conceptual than practical - represents the origin point of all ThreadRing communities
- **Unique Landing Page**: Unlike regular ThreadRings, The Spool's page will not display posts
- **Status Display**: Shows total count of ALL descendants (entire ThreadRing family tree)
- **Genealogy Portal**: Primary link to the interactive genealogical tree of all ThreadRings
- **Universal Parent**: All top-level ThreadRings (those not forked from others) become children of The Spool

**Database Changes Needed**:
- Modify ThreadRing schema to ensure all rings have a parent (either another ring or The Spool)
- Create The Spool as a special system ThreadRing with unique properties
- Update fork creation logic to assign The Spool as parent for orphaned rings

### Performant Descendant Counting Strategy

**The Challenge**: Computing ALL descendants for The Spool requires traversing the entire ThreadRing family tree, which could become expensive with deep hierarchies and many rings.

**Solution: Denormalized Descendant Counters with Incremental Updates**

**Enhanced ThreadRing Schema**:
```prisma
model ThreadRing {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // Hierarchical fields
  parentId          String?    // Direct parent ThreadRing
  parentUri         String?    // For federated parents
  
  // Denormalized counters for performance
  directChildrenCount    Int    @default(0)    // Immediate children only
  totalDescendantsCount  Int    @default(0)    // ALL descendants (recursive)
  
  // Cached lineage data
  lineageDepth          Int    @default(0)    // How deep in the tree (Spool = 0)
  lineagePath           String @default("")   // Comma-separated ancestor IDs for quick queries
}
```

**Incremental Update Strategy**:

When a new ThreadRing is created or forked:
1. **Increment Direct Parent**: `directChildrenCount += 1` for immediate parent
2. **Increment All Ancestors**: `totalDescendantsCount += 1` for all ancestors up the lineage chain
3. **Use Lineage Path**: Pre-computed ancestor path makes updates efficient

**Implementation Example**:
```typescript
async function createThreadRingFork(parentId: string, newRingData: any) {
  // Create the new ring
  const newRing = await prisma.threadRing.create({
    data: {
      ...newRingData,
      parentId,
      lineageDepth: parentRing.lineageDepth + 1,
      lineagePath: `${parentRing.lineagePath},${parentId}`.replace(/^,/, '')
    }
  })
  
  // Update parent's direct children count
  await prisma.threadRing.update({
    where: { id: parentId },
    data: { directChildrenCount: { increment: 1 } }
  })
  
  // Update ALL ancestors' total descendant counts
  const ancestorIds = newRing.lineagePath.split(',').filter(Boolean)
  if (ancestorIds.length > 0) {
    await prisma.threadRing.updateMany({
      where: { id: { in: ancestorIds } },
      data: { totalDescendantsCount: { increment: 1 } }
    })
  }
}
```

**The Spool's Counter**:
- **directChildrenCount**: Number of top-level ThreadRings (orphans assigned to Spool)
- **totalDescendantsCount**: Total number of ALL ThreadRings in the entire system
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically maintained through incremental updates
- **O(log n) Performance**: Updates are proportional to tree depth, not total size

**Query Performance Benefits**:
```sql
-- Get The Spool's total descendant count (instant)
SELECT totalDescendantsCount FROM ThreadRing WHERE id = 'spool-id';

-- Get any ring's complete family size (instant)
SELECT 
  directChildrenCount,
  totalDescendantsCount,
  lineageDepth
FROM ThreadRing WHERE id = 'any-ring-id';

-- Find all rings at a specific depth (efficient)
SELECT * FROM ThreadRing WHERE lineageDepth = 3;

-- Find all descendants of a ring (efficient with lineagePath)
SELECT * FROM ThreadRing WHERE lineagePath LIKE 'ancestor-id,%' OR lineagePath LIKE '%,ancestor-id,%' OR lineagePath LIKE '%,ancestor-id';
```

**Consistency & Integrity**:

**Background Reconciliation Job**:
```typescript
// Run periodically to ensure counter accuracy
async function reconcileDescendantCounts() {
  const rings = await prisma.threadRing.findMany()
  
  for (const ring of rings) {
    // Recompute actual descendant count
    const actualCount = await prisma.threadRing.count({
      where: {
        OR: [
          { lineagePath: { startsWith: `${ring.id},` } },
          { lineagePath: { contains: `,${ring.id},` } },
          { lineagePath: { endsWith: `,${ring.id}` } },
          { parentId: ring.id } // Direct children
        ]
      }
    })
    
    // Update if discrepancy found
    if (actualCount !== ring.totalDescendantsCount) {
      await prisma.threadRing.update({
        where: { id: ring.id },
        data: { totalDescendantsCount: actualCount }
      })
    }
  }
}
```

**Migration Strategy for Existing Data**:
```typescript
// One-time migration to compute initial values
async function computeInitialLineageData() {
  // 1. Set lineageDepth and lineagePath for all existing rings
  // 2. Compute totalDescendantsCount for each ring
  // 3. Ensure The Spool has accurate count of all rings
}
```

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **Ring Creation**: O(log n) - updates proportional to tree depth
- **Count Queries**: O(1) - instant lookup from denormalized counters
- **Tree Traversal**: O(1) with lineagePath for most queries
- **Memory Overhead**: Minimal - just a few integer fields per ring
- **Consistency**: Background job ensures long-term accuracy

### Hierarchical Feed System

- **Full Lineage Feed**: Advanced option to follow entire family tree (ancestors + descendants)
- **Feed Scope Controls**: Granular settings for how deep to follow lineage (1 level, 2 levels, infinite)

**Performance Considerations**:
- **Recursive Query Optimization**: Use CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for efficient lineage traversal
- **Feed Caching**: Cache lineage feed results with appropriate TTL
- **Selective Loading**: Load feeds on-demand rather than pre-computing all possible combinations
- **Depth Limits**: Enforce maximum depth limits to prevent infinite recursion or performance issues

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Notes

### The Spool Implementation
- The Spool should be created as ThreadRing ID 1 with special system flags
- All parentId fields should default to 1 (The Spool) for orphaned rings
- The Spool's landing page should use a completely different template
- Consider The Spool as read-only (no posts, members, or normal ThreadRing features)

### Performance Considerations
- Lineage queries can become expensive - use proper indexing on parentId
- Consider materialized views for complex genealogy calculations
- Cache tree structures aggressively since they change infrequently
- Use pagination and depth limits to prevent runaway queries

### Privacy & Safety
- All lineage features must respect individual ThreadRing privacy settings
- Random discovery should honor user privacy preferences
- Genealogy tree should hide private rings from unauthorized viewers
- Badge system should prevent inappropriate content through moderation

**Next Phase Priority**: Start with The Spool architecture as it's foundational to all other hierarchical features.

## 🌐 Federation Architecture for Cross-Instance ThreadRings

### Federated Spool Concept

**Distributed Parent System**:
- Each instance has its own local "Spool" (e.g., `https://threadstead.com/threadrings/spool`)
- Cross-instance forking creates **federated lineage chains** that span multiple instances
- **Origin Tracking**: Every ThreadRing maintains a canonical URI to its origin instance
- **Lineage Federation**: Parent-child relationships can exist across instance boundaries

**The Universal Spool Network**:
- Local Spools connect to form a **distributed genealogy network**
- Instance operators can configure **trusted federation partners** for cross-instance forking
- **Spool Discovery**: Instances can discover and link to other Spools in the network
- **Genealogy Bridging**: Interactive tree shows cross-instance relationships with clear instance indicators

### Cross-Instance Forking & Lineage

**Federated Fork Process**:
1. **Local Fork**: User forks a remote ThreadRing, creating local copy with federated parent reference
2. **Origin Notification**: Inform origin instance of the fork via ActivityPub
3. **Canonical URIs**: Maintain immutable references to original ThreadRing across instances
4. **Local Autonomy**: Forked ring operates independently while preserving lineage metadata

**Cross-Instance Lineage Tracking**:
- **Federated Parent References**: `parentUri` field stores full canonical URI (e.g., `https://other-instance.com/threadrings/original-ring`)
- **Local Cache**: Store essential metadata about remote parents (name, instance, member count)
- **Lineage Synchronization**: Periodic updates to maintain accurate cross-instance family trees
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when remote instances are unavailable

### ActivityPub Integration for ThreadRings

**ThreadRing as ActivityPub Actor**:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Group",
  "id": "https://threadstead.com/threadrings/web-dev-circle",
  "name": "Web Dev Circle",
  "summary": "A community for web developers to share and discuss",
  "attributedTo": "https://threadstead.com/users/curator-username",
  "followers": "https://threadstead.com/threadrings/web-dev-circle/followers",
  "members": "https://threadstead.com/threadrings/web-dev-circle/members",
  "inbox": "https://threadstead.com/threadrings/web-dev-circle/inbox",
  "outbox": "https://threadstead.com/threadrings/web-dev-circle/outbox",
  "threadring": {
    "parentUri": "https://origin-instance.com/threadrings/parent-ring",
    "spoolUri": "https://threadstead.com/threadrings/spool",
    "joinType": "open",
    "visibility": "public"
  }
}
```

**Cross-Instance Activities**:
- **Fork Activity**: Notify origin instance when ThreadRing is forked
- **Join/Leave Activities**: Cross-instance membership management
- **Post Syndication**: Share posts to federated parent/child rings (with permission)
- **Member Discovery**: Allow cross-instance member visibility and interaction

### Federated Badge & Discovery System

**Cross-Instance Badge Display**:
- **Instance Attribution**: Badges show origin instance (e.g., "Web Dev Circle @ threadstead.com")
- **Federated Badge CDN**: Distribute badges across instances for performance
- **Badge Verification**: Cryptographic signatures to prevent badge spoofing
- **Template Sharing**: Popular badge templates can be shared across instances

**Federated Discovery & Search**:
- **Cross-Instance Search**: Search ThreadRings across federated network
- **Instance Reputation**: Trust scores for instance-to-instance forking permissions
- **Federated Trending**: Aggregate trending ThreadRings across multiple instances
- **Discovery Networks**: Curated lists of interesting cross-instance ThreadRings

### Database Schema for Federation

**Enhanced ThreadRing Model**:
```prisma
model ThreadRing {
  // Existing fields...
  
  // Federation fields
  canonicalUri     String    @unique  // Full URI: https://instance.com/threadrings/slug
  originInstance   String              // Domain of origin instance
  parentUri        String?             // Full URI of parent (may be remote)
  spoolUri         String              // URI of local spool
  federationKey    String?             // Public key for federation verification
  lastSyncAt       DateTime?           // Last successful federation sync
  
  // Cached remote data (for performance)
  parentMetadata   Json?               // Cached parent ring metadata
  remoteMembers    Json?               // Cached cross-instance member data
  
  // Federation settings
  allowFederation  Boolean   @default(true)
  trustedInstances String[]            // Instances allowed to fork this ring
}

model FederatedSync {
  id               String    @id @default(cuid())
  threadRingId     String
  remoteUri        String
  syncType         String    // "parent", "child", "member"
  lastSuccess      DateTime?
  lastError        String?
  retryCount       Int       @default(0)
  
  threadRing       ThreadRing @relation(fields: [threadRingId], references: [id])
}
```

## 🚩 Feature Flag Implementation Strategy

### ThreadRings Feature Flag Requirements

**All Phase 5 client-side changes MUST be gated behind the existing `threadrings` feature flag** to ensure safe, gradual rollout and the ability to quickly disable features if issues arise.

### Feature Flag Implementation Pattern

**React Component Example**:
```tsx
import { useFeatureFlag } from '@/hooks/useFeatureFlag'

export function SpoolLandingPage() {
  const threadringsEnabled = useFeatureFlag('threadrings')
  
  if (!threadringsEnabled) {
    return <NotFoundPage />
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Spool-specific content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Navigation/Link Example**:
```tsx
export function ThreadRingNavigation() {
  const threadringsEnabled = useFeatureFlag('threadrings')
  
  return (
    <nav>
      {threadringsEnabled && (
        <>
          <Link href="/threadrings/genealogy">Family Tree</Link>
          <Link href="/threadrings/spool">The Spool</Link>
        </>
      )}
    </nav>
  )
}
```

**Settings/UI Controls Example**:
```tsx
export function ThreadRingSettings() {
  const threadringsEnabled = useFeatureFlag('threadrings')
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Basic ThreadRing settings */}
      
      {threadringsEnabled && (
        <div>
          <h3>Advanced Features</h3>
          <label>
            <input type="checkbox" /> Enable parent/descendant feeds
          </label>
          <label>
            <input type="checkbox" /> Participate in random discovery
          </label>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### API Endpoint Strategy

**Backend APIs should be available regardless of feature flag** - the feature flag only controls frontend access to prevent UI exposure of incomplete features. This allows for:

- **Safe testing** of backend functionality
- **Gradual frontend rollout** while backend is stable
- **API-first development** where features can be tested via direct API calls
- **Mobile app compatibility** that may have different feature flag timelines

### Phase 5 Feature Flag Checklist

- [ ] **The Spool navigation** - Links to Spool from other pages
- [ ] **Random discovery buttons** - Member discovery navigation
- [ ] **Cross-instance links** - Federation-related navigation elements

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Default to Feature Flag Check**: Every new UI component should check the feature flag
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Components should render appropriately when feature is disabled
3. **API Independence**: Backend APIs work regardless of frontend feature flag state
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core ThreadRing functionality continues working without Phase 5 features
5. **Clear Documentation**: Each TODO item marked with "Feature Flag Required" needs proper gating

### Rollout Strategy

**Phase 5A: Backend Only**
- Implement all database changes and APIs
- No frontend changes yet - all UI gated behind feature flag
- Test APIs directly for functionality verification

**Phase 5B: Limited Frontend Rollout**
- Enable feature flag for development/staging environments
- Implement and test UI components behind feature flag
- Gather feedback from limited user base

**Phase 5C: Gradual Production Rollout**
- Enable for percentage of users (5%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
- Monitor performance and user feedback
- Quick rollback capability if issues arise

**Feature Flag Benefits for Phase 5**:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complex features like genealogy trees can be quickly disabled
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor impact of new features on system performance
- **User Experience**: Gather feedback before full rollout
- **Development Velocity**: Ship backend changes while frontend development continues

## 📝 Recent Development Notes (2025-08-20)

### Interactive Genealogy Tree Implementation
Successfully implemented the interactive genealogical tree visualization for ThreadRings:
- **Tree Data API**: Created `/api/threadrings/genealogy` endpoint for efficient tree data serving
- **D3.js Visualization**: Built interactive tree component with zoom, pan, and click-to-navigate
- **Genealogy Explorer Page**: Added dedicated page at `/threadrings/genealogy` (feature flag protected)
- **Integration**: Added genealogy links to The Spool landing page and ThreadRings directory

### Fork Hierarchy Bug Fix
Discovered and fixed a critical bug where pre-Spool forks had incorrect parent relationships:
- **Issue**: When The Spool was created, all orphaned rings were assigned to it as parent, overwriting actual fork relationships
- **Solution**: Created `fix-fork-hierarchy.ts` script that restores relationships from ThreadRingFork table
- **Result**: Proper multi-level hierarchy now displays correctly (e.g., Spool → test → test Fork → test Fork Fork)
