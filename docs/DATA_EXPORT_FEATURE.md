### Export Structure

```json
{
  "exportMetadata": {
    "exportDate": "2025-10-01T12:34:56.789Z",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "userDid": "did:key:...",
    "primaryHandle": "username@domain.com",
    "totalRecords": {
      "posts": 42,
      "threadrings": 5,
      "comments": 128,
      "media": 15,
      "followers": 20,
      "following": 30,
      "guestbookEntries": 8
    }
  },
  "profile": { ... },
  "posts": [ ... ],
  "threadrings": [ ... ],
  "comments": [ ... ],
  "media": [ ... ],
  "social": { ... },
  "guestbook": [ ... ],
  "account": { ... }
}
```

## Security & Rate Limiting

### Rate Limiting
- **Limit:** 1 export per hour per user
- **Purpose:** Prevent abuse and reduce server load
- **Enforcement:** API level (currently soft limit, can be enhanced with dedicated tracking)

### Authentication
- Requires active user session
- Authenticated via session token
- No capability token required (user's own data)

### Privacy Considerations
- Only includes user's own data
- Media URLs point to existing resources (not duplicated)
- Sensitive internal IDs are included but not exposed publicly
- No other users' private data is included

### For Developers

#### API Request
```bash
GET /api/user/export/data
Authorization: [Session token via cookie]
```

#### API Response
```
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="threadstead-data-export-[timestamp].json"

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (`/pages/api/user/export/data.ts`)

**Main Components:**
1. `handler()` - API route handler
   - Authenticates user
   - Checks rate limits (future enhancement)
   - Calls export generation
   - Returns JSON download

2. `generateUserExport()` - Data gathering function
   - Queries database for all user-related data
   - Transforms data to export format
   - Builds complete export object
   - Returns structured JSON

**Database Queries:**
- Single comprehensive query with all includes
- Optimized with Prisma relations
- Ordered by creation date (most recent first)

### Frontend (`/pages/settings/index.tsx`)

**UI Components:**
1. Export section in Privacy & Consent tab
2. Information boxes (what's included, rate limit)
3. Export button with loading state
4. Success/error messages

**Download Flow:**
1. User clicks export button
2. Show "Generating..." message
3. Fetch from `/api/user/export/data`
4. Create blob from response
5. Trigger browser download
6. Clean up resources
7. Show success message

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Export Log Table**
   - Track export history
   - Enforce rate limiting properly
   - Audit trail for compliance

2. **Selective Exports**
   - Choose specific data categories
   - Partial exports (e.g., only posts)
   - Date range filtering

3. **Additional Formats**
   - CSV export (tabular data)
   - Markdown archive (human-readable)
   - HTML static site (backup)

4. **Direct Transfer**
   - Export to another Threadstead instance
   - Import functionality
   - Platform migration tools

5. **Scheduled Exports**
   - Automated weekly/monthly backups
   - Email delivery option
   - Cloud storage integration

### Technical Improvements

- Redis-based rate limiting
- Background job processing (for large datasets)
- Streaming export for memory efficiency
- Compression (ZIP archive)
- Encryption at rest (if stored temporarily)

## Testing

- Comments and interactions

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Monthly:** Review export logs and usage patterns

### Monitoring

Track these metrics:
- Export requests per day/week
- Export file sizes
- Export generation time
- Error rates
- Rate limit hits
